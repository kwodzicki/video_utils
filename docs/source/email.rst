Email Alerts
============
It is possible to receive email alerts when files finish coverting, or when something breaks.
These emails will contain the last `n` logging messages (50 by default).
Multiple email address can be set to receive these messages.

To set this up, an account on an smtp email server, such as GMail or Yahoo, is required [1]_.
The information for this account can then be used in the :doc:`User Settings <./settings>` to enable email alerts.

See :doc:`User Settings <./settings>` for some information on how to set this up.

.. warning::

  Email alerts are still being developed and are not fully tested.

   If using a GMail account, you will likely have to obtain an App Password.
   In this case, just use the App Password as the password for the account.
